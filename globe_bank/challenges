CHallenge 1: Add a page 
*Link from /staff/index.php to /staff/pages/index.php
*Add HTML and PHP for /staff/pages/index.php.
* Use /staff/subjects as a reference, but do not copy/paste
*Use a $pages array to hold a list of pages.
*Link each page to /staff/pages/show.php. 
*Include the page ID as a URL parameter in that link
*Retrieve and display the page ID

Notes: 
-Use the file path techniques for including files(include, require, include_once, required_once) and
the constant that we shared for the shared path that we made us of. 

-Use the URL techniques for creating links 
-Encode dynamic data used for links and HTML;
urlencode -> for dynamic data used in URLs
htmlspecialchars -> for any dynamic data output to HTML

*Set $page_title for all pages. 


Challenge 2: Add Forms 

Add form for /staff/pages/new.php 
Add form for /staff/pages/edit.php 
Add links to both pages 
Remember: editing requires a page ID. 

Add single-page form processing for both forms .
If form was not submitted, display form 
If form was submitted, display form parameters and form 
Display submitted menu_name on the forms 

Bonus: display submitted position and visible on forms 


Challemge 3: 
-Log into MySQL 
-Use the database globe_bank
-Create a table for pages 
-pages: id ->primary key 
        ->subject_id:integer 
        ->menu_name: string 
        ->position:integer 
        ->visible:boolean 
        ->content: text 
-Add indexes on all foreign keys 
-Add data for the pages: see Ch.5 video7 2:43 
-Try CRUD SQL commands 
-Find subjects by their primary key 
-Find pages by their primary and foreign keys


Challenge 4 :
Use database connection from initialize.php
Query pages table for all records, sorted by position.
Put query in a function: find_all_pages()
Loop through result set
Free the result set when done using it
Confirm the database connection is being closed
Handle errors on the connection and query

Challenge 5: Pages CRUD
-Read a page: /staff/pages/show.php
-Create a page: /staff/pages/new.php
-Update a page: /staff/pages/edit.php
-Delete a page: /staff/pages/delete.php
-Select-option for position
-Bonus: display subject names in place of subject_id
-Advanced: Create a select-option of subjects -> on new. php and edit.php
Hint: You may want to use a while loop instead of a for loop for these select options

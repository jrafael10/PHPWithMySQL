project directories structure
public/ becomes our web document route
everything in public/ is public. This is where to put all the web pages
that a user should be able to see, as well as images, stylesheets, javaScripts,
or any other media or assets that our website needs to function

private directory: content should not be accessible by the public.
This is where we can put our libraries of php code and the public won't be able
to access it directly. But the php files in the public directory can still access
that code stored in the private/ directory because they have access via the file system.
THat is, they can navigate the hard drive structure in order to load those files.


Index.php file: It's a good practice to always have index.php page in every single
public directory that you create as it's possible to have a web server which is configured
to display the contents of the directory whenever an index.php page is not present

basic_php_project/
  public/
    index.php
    images/
    stylesheets/
  private/
    initialize.php
    functions.php

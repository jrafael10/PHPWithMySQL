Section 3 Movie 3 : Output Buffering
PHP code send data 
then web server receives the output. 

Think of a faucet(php code) pouring water on the glass(web server)
As soon as the web server receives its first drops of data, it creates 
the headers for the data and they can't be changed. Once the php code is complete,
web server takes the accumulated data and send it to the users browser. 

Output buffer: 

output from the php code goes into the output buffer and then when it's full, or 
when the php code is done, we take all of that data in the buffer, and we pour it into
the web server. Then web server returns the data into the user's web browser just like before 

Output Buffering 
-Data in output buffer is editable 
-Headers can be changed. 
-Whitespace can be sent before header edits and redirects. 

use phpinfo to check information about output buffering 

You can turn on and off outout buffering 
through php functions
ob_start() ->starts out with buffering. THis 
has to come before any content. THe same as headers 
You can use it a second time if you've already got it turned on in your PHP file.

ob_end_flush(); -> ends buffering and flushes 
whatever result have accumulated over to the web server. 

-Best to turn output buffering in in php.ini file
-Use ob_start() when code may be ported to other servers

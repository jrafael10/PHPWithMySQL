HTTP Header

We can use php to give instruction 
to web server on how to construct this header. 
We do that using the header function 
header($string);
$string can be any line added to the header 
ex: 
header("Content-Type: application/pdf");
->THis tells the content-type should not be html 
but they're about to send a pdf file. 
ex:
header("HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found");
or
header("HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error");
->Responding to browser with an error message 

Notes: 
-Headers are sent before page data
-Changes must be made before any HTML output
    Before a single space or line return 
    Before whitespace in included files 
    Can come after whitespace inside PHP tags

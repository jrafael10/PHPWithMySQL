Validate form values:

-Validate data before creating and updating records
-Same validations are often used for both
-Put validations code in a reusable function
-If validations fail, create or update is prevented
-User needs to know what was wrong so they fix it.
-Keep track of errors and report them
-Reporting all errors at once is the best user experience

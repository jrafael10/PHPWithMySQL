We want the  '&' to be seen as data and not a meaningful 
character in the url. 
<a href="page.php?company=Widgets&More">Link</a>

urlencode($string)


rawurlencode($string)

-Anything that is not reserved characters(Letters,
numbers, underscorem and dash are unchanged)
-Reserved characters are encoded.
-urlencode: spaces become "+".
-rawurlencode: spaces become "%20".

How and Where to use it?
rawurlencode the path 
->Path is the part before the "?".
Spaces must be encoded as "%20".

urlencode the query string 
Query string is the part after the "?".
Spaces are better enoded as "+".


urldecode($string) and rawurldecode($string)
->These are rarely needed because PHP automatically calls 
the decode functions  when it receives a url. 
->As soon as PHP gets that URL, it parses it, it figures out whre 
the query parameters are , it decodes the values, and then it puts 
them into your superglobal forget,

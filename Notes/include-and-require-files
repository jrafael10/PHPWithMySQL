<?php include('funtions.php'); ?>

Inside our PHP tags, we use include, and then the file name we want to include.

-Libraries of functions
-Layout sections:header, footer, navigation, sidebar
-Reusable sections of code(HTML, PHP, and JS);

-Include()
-require() --> Works exactly like include does, except it raises an error if the file
is not found and able to be loaded. Use require() if the file is essential to the operation
of the rest of the page. If we get to require() and something is wrong, the rest of the php
code will simply not execute. Include() doesn't do that.

-include_once()  & require_once() --> works the same way as include() and require(), except
that they also keep track in PHP when a file is loaded. And if you ask it to load that file again,
it'll skip over it.

example:

somepage.php?page=2

page=2 -->url parameter

you can send more than one url parameter by using ampersand parameter between them

somepage.php?category=7&page=3

URL parameters are useful because they allow us to pass data from one page to another
via links.

-Super global variable: $_GET -> used to access the value of url parameter.
Note: the url parameter is an associative array, so to access its value, you denote,
$_GET['page'] in which page is the key.

$page = $_GET['page'] --> setting the variable $page into the value of  global variable $_GET['page'];
Values being retrieved from super globals are always going to be strings, even if the
value being set is an integer.
ex:

$page_as_int = (int) $_GET['page']; --> casting the value of $_GET into integer since its value is retrieved as
a string.
echo gettype($page_as_int);
//integer
